            <h3>Welcome! I'm John Ryan Romero, a passionate digital artist and photographer dedicated to capturing
               the beauty of the world through my lens and imagination. With a background in visual arts and months of
               experience working with both digital media and traditional photography, I strive to blend creativity with
               technical expertise in every project I undertake.Photography is my way of telling stories, whether through
               portraits, landscapes, or abstract compositions. As a digital artist, I sometimes combine these photographs with digital
               techniques to craft unique and evocative pieces that reflect my imagination. I draw inspiration from other digital art,
               game characters, and the ever-changing digital world, always seeking new ways to express ideas visually.
               Whether it's through a camera or a digital canvas, my work aims to provoke thought, stir emotions, and leave
               a lasting impression. Explore my portfolio to see how I push the boundaries of digital art and photography in
               the pursuit of creative expression.</h3>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>I've been exploring  photography for over months, 
                  capturing everything from portraits to landscapes. My journey began with a simple imagination, 
                  but quickly evolved to a better camera phone as I honed my skills in composition, lighting, and editing. 
                  My experience spans digital photography, post-processing techniques, 
                  and creating visual stories that resonate with my self. Whether shooting in natural light or using studio 
                  setups, my goal is always to create compelling images that shows and capture the essence of each 
                  moment.</p>

                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p>As a digital artist, I've spent several weeks refining my craft using tools like Ibis paint and
                   krita. My experience spans digital illustration and photo 
                   manipulation, creating artwork for personal projects and Hobbies. I love blending 
                   traditional techniques with digital mediums to bring unique ideas to life. Whether it's designing logos,
                   creating digital paintings, or illustrating characters, I'm always experimenting with new styles 
                   and concepts. Each project allows me to push creative boundaries and continually evolve as an artist, 
                   turning concepts into art.</p>

                <h3>Editing</h3>
                <p>As a beginner in editing, I have been learning and experimenting with various editing 
                   software such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capcut. My experience includes basic photo and
                   video editing, such as color correction, cropping, retouching, and adding simple effects.
                   I have worked on personal projects, such as editing travel photos and short videos, and have
                   gained skills in improving image quality, enhancing details, and creating clean, polished visuals.
                   I'm excited to expand my editing knowledge and refine my techniques, constantly exploring new tools
                   and approaches to improve the overall quality of my work.</p>
